# Handwriting Recognition using Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM


This project focuses on **handwriting recognition** using three popular machine learning algorithms: **Decision Tree**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. The goal is to classify **handwritten digits** from the **patern_dataset**, making it a foundational project for more advanced applications like Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## Introduction
Handwriting recognition is a challenging task in the fields of image processing and machine learning. This project implements three machine learning algorithms—Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM—to classify **handwritten digits** from the **patern_dataset**. The performance of each algorithm is evaluated and compared to determine the most effective approach.

## Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms are implemented in this project:

1. **Decision Tree**:
   - A simple and interpretable model used for classification tasks.
   - Pros: Fast training and minimal preprocessing required.
   - Cons: Prone to overfitting if parameters are not tuned properly.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - A non-parametric algorithm that classifies data based on similarity.
   - Pros: Simple to implement and no training phase required.
   - Cons: Computationally expensive for large datasets.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
   - A powerful algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
   - Pros: Effective in high-dimensional spaces and robust to overfitting.
   - Cons: Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters.

## Dataset
The project uses the **patern_dataset**, a for handwritten digit recognition. The dataset includes:
- **The handwriting of 20 people has written 10 numbers each.**

Each image is a **have been resized to 70 x 70.** of a handwritten digit (0-9).
